# Exp 10(b) Hybrid inheritance using interfaces

# Aim
To write a Java program to demonstrate hybrid inheritance using interfaces in Java.

## Algorithm

1. Start the program.
2. Create an interface Animal with a method eat().
3. Create an interface Pet that extends Animal and declares a method play().
4. Create a class Dog that implements the Pet interface.
5. Define the eat() and play() methods in the Dog class.
6. Create an object of the Dog class.
7. Call both methods and display the output.
8. Stop the program.

#program

interface Animal {
    void eat();
}

interface Pet extends Animal {
    void play();
}

class Dog implements Pet {
    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("Dog is eating");
    }

    public void play() {
        System.out.println("Dog is playing");
    }
}

public class Exp10b_HybridInheritance {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog d = new Dog();

        d.eat();
        d.play();
    }
}

## Result

Thus, the Java program demonstrating hybrid inheritance using interfaces was written and executed successfully.
